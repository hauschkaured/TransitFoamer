# TransitFoamer 2

This project is my foray into making a large project in Rust and as such will 
undoubtedly suffer from first-time user pitfalls. I have endeavored to replicate
the behavior of my first major programming project (TransitFoamer) which was
written in Python. In addition, I sought to add functionality to my project 
which would have been difficult to add to it in the state it was formerly in.

I have made much more extensive use of modularity and separation of concerns for
this project than I did for my previous, which was significantly more haphazard
than I would have liked.
